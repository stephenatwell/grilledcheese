Dalle 2 prompt: a grilled cheese sandwich running on kubernetes

Chat GPT Prompt: write a docker image for a website that displays an image of a grilled cheese sandwich
Chat GPT Response:
Here's an example of a Dockerfile that creates a Docker image for a simple website that displays an image of a grilled cheese sandwich:

bash
Copy code
# Use an existing image as the base image
FROM node:14-alpine

# Set the working directory in the container
WORKDIR /app

# Copy the necessary files into the container
COPY index.html /app
COPY grilled_cheese.jpg /app

# Start the website
CMD ["http-server", "-p 8080"]
This Dockerfile uses a node.js base image (node:14-alpine) and sets the working directory to /app. It then copies the index.html file and grilled_cheese.jpg image into the container, and starts an HTTP server using the http-server package to serve the website.

The index.html file should contain the following HTML code:

php
Copy code
<html>
  <head>
    <title>Grilled Cheese</title>
  </head>
  <body>
    <h1>Grilled Cheese</h1>
    <img src="grilled_cheese.jpg" alt="Grilled Cheese">
  </body>
</html>
To build the Docker image, run the following command in the directory containing the Dockerfile:

Copy code
docker build -t grilled-cheese .
This will create a Docker image with the tag grilled-cheese.

To run the image, use the following command:

css
Copy code
docker run -p 8080:8080 grilled-cheese
This will start a container based on the grilled-cheese image and bind the container's port 8080 to the host's port 8080, so that you can access the website in your web browser at http://localhost:8080.
